Report for Lab 1
----------------

After you complete lab 1, please answer the following questions.  For lab 1, the questions are simple but in future labs you can expect to spend some time answering more detailed questions about the design of your solution.

1. What is your name?  If you work with a partner, be sure to write both of your names.

Sam Daulton

2. What did you think of this assignment?

I definitely learned a lot.  Implementing all the different classes and their methods helped me absorb a lot of the material in the reading and lectures.  In addtion, my Java skills were a bit rusty, and Lab 1 was a great refresher.

3. What was the hardest part of this assignment?

The hardest part was debugging.  I probably spent 7+ hours debugging the Heapfile and SeqScan classes.

4. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

To my knowledge it is complete.  

5. Roughly how long did you spend working on this lab?

Probably about 20 hours.
