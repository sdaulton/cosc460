Report for Lab 6
----------------

Exercise 1.

1. Briefly explain how logging is done in SimpleDB by describing when log records are written to the log.  Use Eclipse search tools to find all uses of the LogFile methods in the SimpleDB source code.

    SimpleDB writes log records to disk in the BufferPool.flushPage() method.  This method is
    called inside flushPages() which is called inside TransactionComplete
    if and only if a transaction commits.  Moreover, the records are logged
    writing the actual page to disk.
    In Transaction.start(): logXactionBegin() is called; in Transaction.transactionComplete(): logAbort() and logCommit() are called;
    in BufferPool.flushPage(): logWrite() and force() are called; in LogFileRecovery.print(): readPageData is called;
    


2. Where is LogFile.force called?  You should include usages inside other LogFile methods.  For each usage, why is it important that force is called?

    LogFile.force is called in BufferPool.flushPage(), which is crucial since we need to flush the log records to the log file before
    we actually write the page to file.  Thus, we must force the write to the log file to make sure that the log records are written.
    
    LogFile.force is also called in logFile.logAbort, which is important because we want to be sure to write the log record 
    indicating that a txn aborted to the log file.  Thus we force the write.
    LogFile.force is also called in logFile.logCommit, since we want to guarantee that the log record indicating a txn commited
    is written to the log file.
    LogFile.force is also called in logFile.logCheckpoint, which is important because at the checkpoint we want to push everything
    in the BufferPool to disk and everything in the log to disk.  Thus, we call force() to guarantee that the checkpoint actually
    the log files and dirty pages to disk.


3. Where is setBeforeImage image called?  

    It is called in BufferPool.transactionComplete, when a transaction commits.  Thus when a transaction commits, we set the before
    image of the page to the current image of the page.
    It is also called in HeapPage.HeapPage(), i.e. when a new page is created, we set the before image.


Exercise 4.

In answering the next few questions, oncy include method calls in the source code; method calls in the test code can be ignored.
